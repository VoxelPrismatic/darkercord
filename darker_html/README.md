# #] WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
This is where all the extra HTML files go. Instead of creating each part of the UI by hand, which would take forever,
I'm just importing the completed output. Basically, these are time savers and space savers.

| Name | Purpose |
| - | - |
| `darker_masks.html` | Provides the icon set for stuff like status icons for the square theme | 
| `darker_update.html` | Update popup | 
| `darker_settings_panel.html` | Button group in the Discord settings, right under "App settings" should be "PRIZcord settings" |
| `darker_settings_<name>.html` | Settings screen for that menu. |
